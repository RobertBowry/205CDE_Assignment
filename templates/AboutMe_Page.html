                    <p>For as long as I can remember I have had a passion for technology and later discovered at the start of secondary school that I had a passion for business too. Naturally, this passion for both business and technology led to me taking double business and IT for my GCSE options. After getting an A in both these subjects, I then took this a step forward in taking both double business and IT at level where I received two A&#42&#39s for Business Studies and a A&#42 for IT. Deciding I want to take this passion forward, I decided to take a 4 year course at Coventry University studying Business Information Technology which blends both of my passions together into one course.</p>
                    <p>Outside of my work life, I enjoy several things. One of these main things is gaming; remembering the fist game I ever bought which was Guitar Hero 3: Legends of rock. I take pride in having played the guitar hero series for 8 years now, honing my skills through each instrument. If i&#39m not gaming, I will either be listening to music, reading or socialising with my friends. I also enjoy being kept in the loop with what is happening in the world so I check the news on a daily basis.</p>
                    <p>Also being a bit of a nerd or geek when it comes to technology, i&#39m always aware of the new and developing technologies that are coming from around the world, and hope one day to build my own gaming PC once I have the money for it.</p>
