Project 1:</a> For this first Project, we had to analyse a specific sector using examples of existing companies to help us. We chose the automotive industry. As  BI company, we used this details we collected and then provided them a service so that when our clients came to us; we give them a detailed insight into whether or not it would be worth them moving into that sector.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://robertbowry.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/a-l-l-project-2.pdf">A.L.L. Project 2:</a> For our second project, we had to create an API using Python. The API would download data from different data sources and then organize them in a way in which our clients could interpret it. As a BI company, this API would be used by our clients and would be able to view different financial data and could make queryâ€™s for (for example) total assets.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://robertbowry.files.wordpress.com/2015/02/a-l-l-project-3.pdf">A.L.L. Project 3:</a> For our third and final project, we have to use CSI to find a solution to a problem that occurred during a second project. The solution to said problem involved creating a database using an ORM of our choice; deciding to create a database using SQL+. In addition to this, for each table we created within this database, we had to create a class for each table and then implement them into Python so we can import and view data from our database in SQL in Python.</p>
